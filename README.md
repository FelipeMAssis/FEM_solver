# FEM Analysis with Python
This project is a simple Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis tool implemented in Python. It models a 2D truss structure, allowing you to define nodes, elements, materials, and boundary conditions. The tool calculates the displacements and internal forces in the structure and visualizes the results.

## Features
Nodes and Elements: Define the geometry of the structure using nodes and connect them with elements.
Material Properties: Assign material properties such as Young's modulus to the elements.
Boundary Conditions: Apply constraints and loads to the nodes.
Global Stiffness Matrix Assembly: Automatically assemble the global stiffness matrix from the element stiffness matrices.
Displacement and Force Calculation: Solve the system of equations to find nodal displacements and reaction forces.
Visualization: Plot the deformed shape of the structure to visualize the results.
